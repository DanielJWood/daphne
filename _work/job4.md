# MakerMakes
## A cooking application that also accommodates low-vision or blind users.

### Challenge
Cooking from a recipe can be difficult with occupied hands and ingredients scattered across the kitchen. The cooking experience breaks when regular and low-vision users canâ€™t easily access recipes as they make meals. 

### Process
In order to better understand the needs of low-vision users and how they might go about cooking, I watched YouTube videos of professional chefs and ordinary people who are either blind or limited in their vision. I also interviewed my visually impaired friend on his approaches to cooking. 



I also downloaded other cooking applications and made notes of UI and UX elements that I wanted to incorporate. 





### Design
Borrowing from the Google Sprint method, I initially made sketches on post-it notes for wireframes. 



I made the landing page pre-populated with recipes so that users could immediately get inspiration for what they wanted to make. The main action that users engage with is search, which I placed at the top. Users have the option to search, clear search, or filter.


Users can filter by different criteria such as dietary preferences, preparation time, cuisines, course type, and calorie count. After a filter is added, a red check mark appears. 


When users navigate to a recipe, they can skip from section to section by swiping left or right. 

Another key component of the app is its bottom navigation. When I first drew the wireframes, I wanted to insert a left panel but decided that core actions should always be accessible considering the two user types I was designing for. 

The bottom navigation is made up of: speech-to-text, ingredients list, home, favorited recipes, and app information. Speech-to-text is distinctly the first icon so that users could easily navigate to it and give it specific directions, which would be translated back to the app. This would also be activated when users double tap the screen.
