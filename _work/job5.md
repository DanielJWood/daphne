# EduInsider
## A higher education analytics application that compares institution data on a mobile device.

### Challenge
The VP of Enrollment of College X wants to have access to student data on-the-go so that she have more context on why dropout rates are increasing. 

### Process
I wanted to make comparisons easy for the VP of Enrollment. Historical data was also important for me to surface, knowing that it would offer a stronger story and deeper sense of student behavior. 

I made quick sketches and wireframes of the same screen and limited myself to one minute per sketch. I didnâ€™t end up having one sketch I mirrored completely in the prototype. All these ideas collectively inspired the prototype later on. 



### Design
Since KPIs were always going to be top of mind, I populated the home screen with the requested KPIs. Since there are two other screens the VP of Enrollment could tap to, I added two buttons in the bottom right that would take them to either choice immediately. 



I also added the bottom navigation, which holds three stationary icons. The VP can save a copy of the data to her personal device, email the screen to colleagues, or immediately schedule meetings to discuss the data she just reviewed. 


The details screen allows the VP to choose a given KPI and see data from the past five years. I coupled a bar chart with a grid so that the user would get to visually digest the metrics and also see the actual numbers in a linear format. 

For the comparison screen, the VP can choose the state and institution she wishes to compare to College X. From there, the selected school would populate the data in the colored grid so that users could see side by side the gaps between the two schools. 


In my second version of the comparison screen on the far right, I focused on making comparisons completely visual and interactive. The VP could tap on a map to find her school of choice then select the variable she wanted to compare. To make up for the lack of a grid, I made sure that the bar chart would be colored by school and that data values would be marked on the chart itself.
