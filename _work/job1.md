## Reimagining MicroStrategy 

### Reconfiguring the accessibility of main actions in the MicroStrategy Desktop interface.

MicroStrategy Desktop is for the business analyst who isn’t familiar with deep analytical tools and wants to spin up dashboards within minutes to present his or her insights beautifully. However, I found the ease of use lacking, particularly in formatting ease and the immediate visibility of core actions. I decided to rethink how certain features of Desktop could be surfaced that would make some steps of dashboard creation swifter.

#### Initial Research 

Inspired by the Google Sprint method, I first started by looking at competing interfaces and making notes of what worked really well or I found easy to use. I looked specifically at Tableau, Microsoft Power BI, QlikView and other project creation tools such as Google Docs, Slides, Keynote, and Powerpoint for varied frameworks.

Alongside competitive analysis, I mapped out what the typical user might do when they first download MicroStrategy Desktop.

#### Sketching and ideation 

I did a quick and rough storyboard of the new experience on Google Slides. This includes basic steps such as adding data, picking a visualization, formatting the visualization, adding text and images, and saving content. While all these features are currently available in Desktop, the core actions aren’t all immediately visible when you enter the interface. I wanted to make all these actions accessible and harness a “grab-and-go” feeling.

#### Prototyping

Following the quick rough workflow, I made a prototype in Keynote, which allowed me to make a pretty intricate prototype without the full-blown details of Sketch. The prototype made clear to me how tricky reconfiguring formatting visualizations could be. What I learned the most from prototyping is how there are still many clicks to go through in order to format a visualization. There are so many components to a visualization, advanced analytical tools still require some sort of testing and training for a new user.
