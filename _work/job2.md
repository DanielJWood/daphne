# MicroStrategy Marketplace
## A one-stop shop for data and business analysts to find the data visualizations and dashboards that inspire them.

### Challenge
Data analytics isn’t as accessible as it should be. MicroStrategy wanted to offer new, non-technical users an easy way to play with data, but there was no place for customers, prospects, or data enthusiasts to access the content MicroStrategy’s engineering and product marketing teams had created.

### Role
Project and customer experience lead

### Teams Involved
Technology & Marketing

### Process
From Google Analytics and other marketing data, I gathered that “D3” (data-driven documents) had been a top five search term for six months, indicating a growing and sustained interest in data visualizations. Months prior, I initiated the creation and launch of MicroStrategy’s Github so that developers could shop for data visualization plug-ins. However, Github intimidates consumer users who do not know code but want to play with their data. These users needed somewhere else to go to download MicroStrategy specific code. 

After looking through community posts and picking apart product management’s customer feedback, I compared and contrasted what was beneficial for our customers and for us as an organization. 

For the visualization library, I worked with MicroStrategy’s data visualization team to understand their objectives for the imagined user experience upon arriving at the community. Using Lithium’s documentation to navigate through the sandbox environment, I created the library skeleton and layout before testing and seeding the community’s staging environment with sample plug-ins. 

Months later, I worked with product owners from the Technology team to get the Dashboard Gallery up and running. This would serve to support the launch of a new marketing campaign called “Desktop Free.” The gallery serves as an inspirational space for business analysts who want something to help them get started as they analyze their data. 

### Results
The [Visualization Library](https://community.microstrategy.com/t5/Visualization-Library/bg-p/vizgallery)  project from start to finish lasted eight weeks. This process was repeated for the [Dashboard Gallery](https://community.microstrategy.com/t5/Dashboard-Gallery/bg-p/dashboardgallery) and was released alongside MicroStrategy’s Desktop campaign within three weeks. The architecture and skins are fairly similar, making the speed of developing the gallery simple and a quick win.
