# Community Design & Development
## Develop and introduce gamification into a business intelligence B2B forum to increase user engagement. Configure new forum structure to best reflect user interests while maintaining logical integrity of MicroStrategy’s information architecture. 

### Challenge 
MicroStrategy’s forums were old and outdated. There was a point system, but it lacked a true sense of reward and failed to encourage new users from sticking around. The forums were dying quickly, powered by a select number of extremely technical engineers. 

### Role
Project lead

### Teams Involved 
Marketing & Technical Support 

### Process
Before getting started, I dissected data pulled from the old forums, reviewed comments from remaining active users, and looked at the types of activity that most often occurred in the forum. 

Based on community data and customer requests, the marketing web team and I settled on four separate buttons to point users to specific places of interest: discussion forums, knowledge base, idea exchange, and developer zone. 

(comment: this is supposed to be a bulleted list but somehow, it isn't coming through)

- Forums are for collaboration, where users ask questions about business intelligence strategy or feature workarounds and issues
- Knowledge base acts as the technical note repository for all our products
- Idea exchange is a space for anyone to submit product enhancement requests
- Developer zone is for technical users looking for code and documentation to customize their MicroStrategy application

Three custom components were added below these four groups to highlight technical and marketing content and user activity. “Announcements” allows for customized messages. “Top Liked Authors” lists the top 5 individuals who are well-liked in the community that week. “Recent Blog Articles” highlights blog articles that were recently published, offering at first glance what the community is buzzing about.

Finally, to address the lack of user interaction, I developed badges and rankings that reflected MicroStrategy’s personality and community goals. Each badge mirrored a type of behavior I wanted to cultivate in the new community. This includes posting answers, asking questions, or sharing thought pieces, and are denoted by badge color. Ranking names and symbols communicated to users where they stood in MicroStrategy specific knowledge and expertise based on a combination of stars and bar charts. 

### Results

During my tenure as community lead (September 2014-June 2016), the community had exponential growth--notably an 85% increase in user registration, 80% increase in topic creation, and 350% increase in unique visitor count.
