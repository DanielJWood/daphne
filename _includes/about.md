Hi there! 

Welcome to this very neat internet website that I made for the world wide web. I'm Dan Wood, web developer and data viz specialist for Energy.gov. I've worked here for a few years and now I'm looking for my next big adventure. 

A little about my work: My job is to build neat visualizations and tools to help the American people understand broad, but important energy trends. I try to take complicated, esoteric, data rich stories and translate them into visually stimulating and relatable pieces. Lately I've enjoyed honing my server-side skills, scraping large amounts of data and serving it seamlessly to increase the flexibility and self-sufficiency of some of our products. 

Away from the computer, I'm a big fan of exploring the city, hiking, gardening, and writing music with my wife. When I'm not doing that, I enjoy tinkering with math and D3 to make some pretty weird things. 

A final note: The image below helped me gain a [modicum of notoriety on reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/33ufn1/this_is_my_coworkers_picture_on_a_government/) a few years back, including this [amazing gif](http://i.imgur.com/FBG3d9r.gifv). It was a pretty strange experience.
