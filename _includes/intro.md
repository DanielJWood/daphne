### Designer, marketer, and maker of things in Washington D.C.

I help people make sense of their data at an advanced [data analytics company](http://microstrategy.com/) and am passionate about the intersection of design, people, and technology. Outside of work, I like creating things such as [photographs](http://www.atmusingsend.com/), baked goods, paintings, or personalized greeting cards.
